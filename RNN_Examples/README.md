## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Course Examples in TensorFlow and Keras:

1. A Futile Stock Price Prediction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
   
   This project predicts stock prices based on historical financial data using RNN LSTM and GRU.

2. Natural Language Processing (Sentiment Analysis) with Recurrent Neural Networks

   This project works on Sentiment Analysis of texts.  In the notebook example, we will classify movie reviews as potitive, negative, or neutral.

3. Natural Language Processing (Character Generation) with Recurrent Neural Network

   This project generates charater using a RNN.  In the notebook example, we will work with a dataset of Shakespeare's writing. Given a sequence of characters from this data ("Shakespear"), train a model to predict the next character in the sequence ("e").  
   
   The model is character-based.
